the given information and extract all required data in the specified format. Only use the information provided in the
DOCUMENT section for this task, without consulting any external sources. In addition, prepare a brief summary of the
CV of the person that gives a good, precise and quick overview of the person in one sentence.
Your response must use the language of the CV.

If any information is missing, incomplete, or not explicitly mentioned in the DOCUMENT section, mark the respective field as 'unknown'.
For fields that might not always be present (e.g., salutation, title, address, hobbies), use 'unknown' where necessary.
