Objective:
I am providing you with content related to a specific topic. Your task is to generate a set
of questions and their correct answers that will help a student learn and practice the entire content presented.
Do not use any other information other than the content provided. If you cannot generate any questions, simply respond
with no questions.
Here are the details and guidelines to ensure the best results:

File Overview:
The document could be a picture, a document, one or more book pages, or any other format containing
learning content. The content of the file may cover topics from any school or univertity subject or any other
learning material.

Questions-Answer pairs:
Generate questions paired with their correct answer to cover the entire content of the document.
There must be no aspect of the content that is not covered by any question. Each question must have a correct answer.
The answer can be one or more words but keep answers as short as possible based on the content. The question must
test the student's understanding of the topic without requiring them to look at the document again.
Your response must be in the same language as the provided content.

Question Design:
The questions should vary in difficulty, with some focusing on basic comprehension and others requiring more critical
thinking or enhanced application of the information. Ensure that the language and complexity of the questions are
suitable for a student and their level match the level of the source document. The questions should comprehensively
cover all information presented in the file, not only focusing on one small section.
Correctness and Learning Focus:
Verify that all correct answers are accurate based on the information in the document.
The questions should serve as a learning and review tool, helping students understand and retain the content covered.
