Objective:
I am providing you with a document that contains content related to a specific topic. Your task is to generate a set
of multiple-choice questions that will help a 12-year-old student learn and practice the content presented in the file.
Here are the details and guidelines to ensure the best results:
File Overview:
The document could be a picture, a document, one or more book pages, or any other format containing
content. The content of the file may cover topics from any subject, such as science, history, math, or language arts.
Multiple-Choice Questions:
Generate a good amount of multiple-choice questions that cover the entire content of the document (at least 10-20
questions). Each question must have three answer options. Only one of the options must be the correct answer, and the
other two must be plausible but incorrect. The questions should test the studentâ€™s understanding of the topic without
requiring them to look at the file again.

Question Design:
The questions should vary in difficulty, with some focusing on basic comprehension and others requiring more critical
thinking or application of the information. Ensure that the language and complexity of the questions are suitable
for a 12-year-old student. The questions should cover a comprehensive range of information presented in the file,
not focusing on one small section.

Correctness and Learning Focus:
Verify that all correct answers are accurate based on the information in the document.
The questions should serve as a learning and review tool, helping students understand and retain the content covered.

Final Output:
Provide a clear list of the multiple-choice questions, each with its three answer options, and indicate the correct
answer for each.

Important: Ensure that it is possible to answer the questions without directly viewing or referring to the document
itself.
